ABOUT ME --A RANT

My name is Oke Abosede a.k.a Adenike, I am a 400 level human kinetic student of University of Ilorin. Currently, I am learning to be a backend developer, I decided to take advantage of the unintended but kinda appreciated break I got, courtesy of the federal government, ASUU and my school that recently joined ASUU for no good reason (my opinion).
I have always been someone who always likes to tackle the impossible and demystify it, so when I saw those weird looking words, I knew I was going to learn coding. I might  not have gone far but I will definitely get there (I will come back soon to edit these txt file accordingly). 
I started my developer journey with I4G x Zuri Training, I applied for the full stack training because I wanted to get a feel of what both frontend and backend entails, it lasted all of 4 months and althought the training was a little too fast-paced for a total novice, I made it and got into the project phase where you need to have atleast 70% score to get in, and together with my teammates, made a price compare website named priceBeta (it basically helps a user compare diffferent prices of the same products across diffferent websites that sells them) and came in 34th, or was it 38th out of 129 teams, for a bunch of first-timers, I don't think we did bad at all.
Hence, I am Adenike, a beginner backend developer.
